## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap library

### What I learned

Well I reinforced my knowledge of the Bootstrap container properties and it really helped in implementing the grid layout of the website beautifully. I also understood the importance of making your codes (especially stylesheets) modular. It saved me much time when implementing active states on the webpage.

### Continued development

The Boostrap components really made the comletion of this project easier. I want to continue gaining mastery of the different ones used and not used in this project to decrease my build time. Also, I want to test the nesting of different components together as well to see their effectiveness in synergy.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap nav bar](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43930068/bootstrap-4-mobile-nav-bar-slide-from-left) - This helped me for the nav bar implementation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS float](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the float property of CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
